>It’s essential to use a VPN for torrenting. When you join a P2P (peer-to-peer) network, other users in the network can see your IP address. Your IP address is tied to your location and identity, so you don’t want to be broadcasting it to strangers.
>
>However, by using a free VPN for torrenting, you’ll cloak your IP address and protect your online privacy. Our pick of the best free VPNs for torrenting are:
>
>    PrivadoVPN: Secure free VPN for torrenting with 10 GB monthly data
>    hide.me: Free, P2P-friendly VPN with decent security
>    Atlas VPN: Free VPN for torrenting, from the company behind NordVPN
>    Windscribe: A free VPN for torrenting in high-censorship nations
>
>Just bear in mind that free VPNs impose data and speed limitations. Not to mention, it’ll severely limit your server choice. That’s why we recommend choosing an unlimited VPN provider with advanced security features, such as NordVPN.
